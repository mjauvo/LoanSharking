# LoanSharking

## Introduction

This is a tiny text-based Java application which is done with 'tongue-in-cheek'. The application keeps track of loans which are owed to various crime bosses, i.e. "Godfathers". The application shows the info on following entitites.

#### Customers

The database stores the name, the address and the contact info of these unfortunate ones who have been forced to resort to borrowing money from these crime bosses.

#### Debts

The database stores the debts with their interest rates, dates that the debts were obtained, due dates and dates when the debts were paid. If the customer is unable to pay the debt in full by due date, a goon is sent to collect.

#### Godfathers

The database stores the name, the address, the nickname and the contact info of the loan sharking crime bosses.

#### Goons

The database stores the muscle-for-hire who do their employers' bidding and ensure that the debts are paid. Goons have a sense of honor in a way that they work only for one crime boss at a time and always follow through until their services are now longer required and thus, they become available.
